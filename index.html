																	<h2 class="major">How I got here</h2>
																	<p>I started my journey into Computer Science my junior year of high school
																        in 2017. I decided to take a Computer Science Elective 
																		Course and in this class my Passion and Admiration of Computer Science
																		Sprouted and Blossomed. I found it not only fascinating but that 
																		writing and creating code came naturally. The projects I had in this class 
																		I'd finish rapidly leading me to add additional features and work on personal
																		project ideas. This enviroment fostered my curiousity as I'd venture to other 
																		sources outside of the classroom to achieve these ideas. This class convinced me
																		to pursue my Computer Science Degree. While pursuing my degree I was able to meet
																		my peers, learning for some and teaching others. My knowledge of the many sub-disciplines
																		grew and I was unsure which of the many possible paths before me to which I should commit.
																		It was after conversing with experienced Software Engineers I was reminded of my initial adoration 
																		for the creating and writing of code; that lead me to pursue Software Engineering. I then finished my degree in January 2024. 
																		So far post-graduation I've been lucky enough to land a Fellowship at Headstarter AI, allowing me to further hone my skills
																		and better prepare myself as a promising candidate for what opportunities await me.
